# Mining-Quality-Prediction
This Machine Learning and Deep Learning project was done using various python libraries like scikit learn, Keras, Tensorflow. This project was done under the guide of Ryan Ahmed to whom I must give credit. His teaching was very elaborate and succinct. The project highlights one valuable application of Machine Learning in the mining industry.
